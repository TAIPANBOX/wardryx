# Checks that the gates in `scripts/` still FAIL on the faults they exist to
# catch, still PASS on what they must not catch, and REFUSE to report success
# when they measured nothing at all.
#
# WHY
#
# Every gate here parses text, and a text parser does not break loudly: it
# stops matching and reports success. The mutants that proved each one existed
# as prose, in commit messages and in the `*(gate: ...)*` markers in CLAUDE.md,
# which is a record of what was true once. Nothing ran them again.
#
# A gate that has quietly stopped catching anything looks exactly like a gate
# with nothing to catch, and stays that way until the fault it guards ships.
#
# WHY THE THIRD PROPERTY IS SEPARATE FROM THE FIRST
#
# `readme-numbers.sh` already refuses in two distinct ways when its subject is
# absent: no test functions at all, and no badge to compare against. Both
# sentences were true, were established by hand once in the session that wrote
# it, and nothing re-ran them.
#
# `decision-path-purity.sh` is the one with the sharper edge. It reads `go
# list` output and matches each import against two lists. A list that stops
# being consulted, or a `go list` that returns nothing, produces exactly the
# same output as a clean tree: silence, then OK. The decision path is where
# this repository answers allow or deny, so a purity check that has quietly
# stopped looking is worse here than almost anywhere else in the estate.
#
# HOW IT MUTATES WITHOUT LEAVING A MESS
#
# It edits tracked files in place, so it refuses to start unless the tree is
# clean, restores with `git checkout` after every case, restores again from a
# trap on any exit path including a kill, and asserts the tree is clean before
# reporting success.
#
# A MUTATION THAT DID NOT APPLY PROVES NOTHING
#
# Every edit asserts it changed the file. A case whose edit applied nothing is
# a failure here, not a pass. That is not hypothetical: five such mutations
# were caught across idryx and tokenfuse on 2026-08-09, and three of the five
# had been verified BY HAND against the same gate minutes earlier. The hand
# version and the harness version differ only in how many layers of quoting sit
# between the text and python, which is exactly the difference nobody sees.
