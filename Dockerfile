# Until now every deployment BUILT this from source on the machine it was
# installing to, which cost minutes on a first run and put the whole Go
# toolchain in the blast radius of an install. What nobody builds, nobody
# breaks.
#
# Static, distroless, non-root, multi-arch. CGO off is what makes the binary
# runnable on distroless static AND what makes cross-compiling to arm64 free:
# there is no C toolchain to arrange, so the arm64 image costs the same as the
# amd64 one.
#
# The binary lands at /usr/local/bin/service and is the ENTRYPOINT, which is
# not cosmetic: the stack's Kubernetes manifests pass `args` and rely on that
# path, so this image is a drop-in replacement for the one they used to build
# on the node.
